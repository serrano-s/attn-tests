Before running `train_model.py`, there must exist a data directory
containing properly formatted data files.

(There also need to exist pretrained word embeddings and an
allennlp vocabulary; the paths to those must be specified in
the config files.)

If you want to use a different data directory location, just change
the location listed in `default_directories.py`.
